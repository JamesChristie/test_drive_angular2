# Test Drive Example for Angular 2

This repository provides a simple example of a test-driven login form. It currently does nothing more than simple validation of form inputs.

## Setup

Clone the repository and run `npm install` to fetch all dependencies. Tests can be run in watch mode with `npm run test:watch` and a single run can be done with `npm run test:single`. To run a development server run `npm start` and browse to `http://localhost:9000`.
